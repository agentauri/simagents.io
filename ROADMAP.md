# AgentsCity Roadmap

> Last updated: 2026-01-02

## Overview

AgentsCity is a persistent "world-as-a-service" where external AI agents live, interact, and evolve. This roadmap tracks implementation progress against the PRD (docs/PRD.md).

**Current Status**: Phases 0-5 Complete ✅
- Phase 0: Kernel (MVP) - Core simulation
- Phase 1: Emergence Observation - Memory, trust, trade
- Phase 2: Social Complexity - Conflict, gossip, roles
- Phase 3: External Agents - A2A protocol, replay
- Phase 4: Advanced Features - Credentials, reproduction, LLM optimization
- Phase 5: Research Platform - Biomes, Experiments, Visualization

**Current Mode**: Scientific Model (Sugarscape-inspired)
- Resources spawn at geographical locations (food, energy, material)
- Shelters provide rest areas
- No predefined location types - emergence is observed, not imposed

## Philosophy: IMPOSED vs EMERGENT

This project strictly separates what the system imposes from what agents create:

### IMPOSED (Infrastructure)
- Grid world (100x100)
- Survival pressure (hunger, energy decay)
- Resource distribution (geographical)
- Currency infrastructure (CITY)
- Physics (movement, time)

### EMERGENT (Agent-Created)
- Movement patterns
- Resource gathering strategies
- Trade conventions (if any)
- Spatial organization
- Social structures
- Reputation systems

**Rule**: The system validates physics, not morality. We observe what emerges.
