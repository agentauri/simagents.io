# SimAgents official relay

This is a separate Cloudflare Worker for the BYOK SPA. It is implemented and tested locally, **not deployed or certified against live providers**. The browser still owns simulation/world state.

## Contract

| Route | Operation | Authentication |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /v1/health` | Static readiness/version; no provider call | Edge rate limit; no access token |
| `POST /v1/models` | First-page model list at an approved provider path | Signed relay token and provider credential |
| `POST /v1/inference` | One bounded, non-streaming text request | Signed relay token and provider credential |

Inference body: `{ providerId, protocol, endpoint, modelId, body }`. Model-list body: `{ providerId, protocol, endpoint }`. `Authorization: Bearer <relay-access-token>` authorizes relay use; `X-Provider-Key` carries the user's separate provider key. No browser cookies or relay tokens are forwarded upstream.

Destinations are exact, reviewed triples in `packages/shared/src/relay-policy.ts`. The actual upstream URL is constructed from that list, not from an arbitrary caller URL. Custom endpoints, workspace-specific URLs not in the list, IP literals, alternate schemes, URL credentials, query strings, and redirects are not accepted. Custom destinations remain available through direct access or a user-controlled relay.

Only the current simulation adapter payloads are allowed. Tools, streaming, remote image/file inputs, background execution, conversation handles, arbitrary headers and model-fallback lists are rejected. OpenAI storage is disabled in the request. Provider privacy/retention policies remain separate from relay behavior.

## Local privacy and limits

The handler has no content telemetry. A separate Durable Object stores bounded temporary technical counters only. It prunes elapsed 60-second windows and 90-second leases through alarms; state and cleanup alarms commit atomically. There is no calendar-boundary reset of active limits. Logical expiry is not a certification of platform backup/log retention. It never writes keys, prompts, responses or exceptions to console, caches, databases, queues or storage bindings. Responses use `Cache-Control: no-store`; upstream fetch bypasses cache. Error responses redact provider text. Wrangler observability is explicitly disabled. Operator-side Cloudflare logging/export settings must also be reviewed before deployment; this source code cannot certify settings outside the repository.

Limits:

- 256 KiB request body; 1 MiB provider response.
- 60-second total deadline, including body reads, and cancellation on client disconnect.
- Six admitted upstream operations per isolate, bounding buffered-response memory.
- Coordinated subject counters: six concurrent leases and 50 forwarded operations per rolling minute. Additional local rate bindings: 60 operations/minute per authenticated subject; 120 edge requests/minute per HMAC-blinded client address as an additional abuse backstop. Edge checks include preflight/health traffic.
- Tokens are valid for at most 15 minutes and are bound to an exact HTTPS application origin. Subject identifiers should be opaque, not email addresses or names.
- No retry, fallback destination or alternate model is selected by this service.

Cloudflare rate limits are local to each Cloudflare location, not a global billing/concurrency guarantee. The isolate admission guard is also not global. Shared IPs can encounter the edge backstop. Capacity, WAF rules, monitoring and actual platform behavior require staging checks before release.

## Deployment preparation — no deploy performed

1. Select the relay domain/route, exact HTTPS SPA origins and rate-limit namespace IDs that do not conflict with another service. The IDs in `wrangler.toml` are template values to review.
2. Configure `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` as a comma-separated list of exact origins. The empty default fails closed. `workers_dev` and preview URLs are disabled.
3. Generate and securely retain a cryptographically random signing secret with at least 32 bytes of entropy. Supply it as the Worker `AUTH_SECRET` secret, never a `VITE_*` variable, committed file or URL. Local `.dev.vars` and `.wrangler` are ignored.
4. Use an operator-selected/pinned Wrangler release supporting rate bindings (Cloudflare documents a minimum of 4.36.0) and the configured compatibility date. Validate with a dry run and review platform logging settings before any authorized rollout. Wrangler/Cloudflare platform validation has not been run in this task.
5. Review the separate [admission service](../admission/README.md), its exact Turnstile hostname/action settings and shared subject-counter binding before deployment. Neither service has been deployed or certified in Cloudflare.
6. After separately authorized deployments, build the SPA with `VITE_OFFICIAL_RELAY_URL=https://<relay-origin>`, `VITE_ADMISSION_URL=https://<admission-origin>` and `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=<public-site-key>`. URLs are HTTPS origins without a path. All three are required to enable public relay access. Existing direct/user-relay connections are not rerouted.
7. Users select **Official relay**, enter their provider key and complete security verification. No operator token, invitation or account is needed. Relay authorization is memory-only and is excluded from the provider vault. At minute 13 the app requests a fresh proof and authenticates renewal with its existing token. An interactive challenge or failed/expired access pauses and blocks new requests; the user resumes explicitly after access returns. Model verification and the world are preserved.

`apps/relay/scripts/mint-token.ts` remains an explicit local diagnostic issuer; it is not the public admission protocol and has not been used to distribute deployment tokens.

## Tests and rollback

`bun run --filter @simagents/relay test` covers authentication, hostile destinations, header isolation, payload/schema restrictions, body limits, redirects, deadlines, slow uploads, error redaction, logging absence, concurrency admission and interoperability with the application's four protocol adapters. `bun run --filter @simagents/relay build` bundles the Worker for inspection.

`scripts/official-relay-smoke.ts` serves a production SPA fixture under a synthetic HTTPS origin, runs this exact handler in process, and stubs all provider calls. It delegates to `admission-browser-smoke.ts`, which covers the actual admission/relay handlers, simulated widget/provider access, silent and interactive renewal, Worker token updates, blocked resume, model-verification/world preservation and credential-free exports. Authorization clocks are simulated; the real-time soak is separate. Rate bindings are simulated; these tests do not validate Cloudflare's deployed rate infrastructure or provider access.

Before release, test deployed TLS/CORS/auth/limits, aggregate latency/errors, WAF policy and provider compatibility with dedicated keys and an authorized budget. Keep app, relay and destination policy versions together. Removing a destination or disabling the relay must fail closed and pause affected sessions, never reroute automatically. Rotating `AUTH_SECRET` revokes access tokens for new admissions (in-flight provider calls may still finish/be billed); an empty origin list disables forwarding. Use aggregate platform metrics only; do not enable body/header logging for debugging.
